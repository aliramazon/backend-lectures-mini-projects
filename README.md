# Backend Projects

## Overview

I taught fullstack JavaScript and TypeScript to 6 students selected from 50 applicants. The focus was on practical, hands-on learning, and included building real-world projects. During the backend development module, we covered the fundamentals using Node.js, Express, Prisma, and MongoDB.

## Teaching Structure

### 1. Building APIs with Vanilla Node.js

-   **Objective**: Understand the core principles of Node.js and how to create a basic API.
-   **Content**:
    -   Introduction to Node.js
    -   Setting up a Node.js project
    -   Handling HTTP requests and responses
    -   Creating a basic API without any frameworks

### 2. Introduction to Express

-   **Objective**: Simplify the process of building APIs by using the Express framework.
-   **Content**:
    -   Introduction to Express
    -   Setting up an Express project
    -   Middleware functions
    -   Routing in Express
    -   Error handling in Express

### 3. Integrating Prisma

-   **Objective**: Use Prisma as an ORM to interact with databases.
-   **Content**:
    -   Introduction to Prisma
    -   Setting up Prisma in a Node.js project
    -   Defining data models with Prisma
    -   Performing CRUD operations with Prisma
    -   Integrating Prisma with MongoDB

### 4. Controller and Router Pattern

-   **Objective**: Structure the codebase using the controller and router pattern for better maintainability.
-   **Content**:
    -   Introduction to the controller and router pattern
    -   Creating controllers and routers in an Express project
    -   Organizing routes and controllers for modularity

### 5. Advanced Patterns: Controller, Router, Services, and Middleware

-   **Objective**: Implement a more scalable and maintainable architecture using advanced patterns.
-   **Content**:
    -   Introduction to services and middleware patterns
    -   Creating service layers for business logic
    -   Implementing middleware for request processing
    -   Structuring a project with controllers, routers, services, and middleware

### 6. Live Projects

Throughout the learning process, students built multiple live projects to apply the concepts learned. The biggest project developed is the **Projectify App**.

## Projectify App

**Projectify** is a comprehensive application developed as part of the backend development learning module to demonstrate the practical application of backend development skills.

-   **Backend Repository**: [Projectify App API](https://github.com/aliramazon/projectify-app-api)
-   **Frontend Repository**: [Projectify App UI](https://github.com/aliramazon/projectify-app-ui)

### Features of Projectify App

-   **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login
-   **Project Management**: Create, update, and delete projects
-   **Task Management**: Manage tasks within projects
-   **Collaboration**: Invite team members to projects
-   **Notifications**: Real-time updates and notifications

### Technologies Used

-   **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications
-   **Express**: Web framework for Node.js
-   **Prisma**: Next-generation ORM for interacting with the database
-   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing application data

## Conclusion

The teaching experience equipped the students with essential skills to build robust and scalable backend applications using modern tools and design patterns. By the end of the teaching period, students had hands-on experience in developing real-world applications and a solid understanding of backend development best practices.
